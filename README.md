# **BAVTS** Academy for Applied Engineering: *Final Project*

### Search & Rescue Rover

My team was tasked to design a remote controlled rescue rover. Obstacles included: being able to travel through water, bidirectional communication, and operating the rover from greater than 20ft. The rover must communicate the following to the operator: temperature, whether or not the rover is in water, whether or not the lights are on, as well as audio/visual data for display. Both Raspberry Pi and Arduino Boards were used in order to complete this task.
